# Design and Scaling teams - WIP

Notes to drive the analysis of the approaches in scaling teams and breaking into smaller ones.

## Design Principles

- Leading by setting the context;
- iteration & experimentation;
- ownership;
- assess the outcome;
- Conwayâ€™s Law;
- autonomy, purpose, and mastery;
- trust

Martin Eriksson in his talk on [Building Awesome Product Teams](https://vimeo.com/240129668) covers the basics. Check also the book 5 dysfunctions of the team ([a good summary](https://www.runn.io/blog/5-dysfunctions-of-a-team-summary)).

## Not covered here

- **hiring**
- **onboarding** - atmost important

Maybe later.

## Challenges - WIP

- cut the communication
- locallity

## Product teams not feature factories
